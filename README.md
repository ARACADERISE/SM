# SM
SM(Simple Makefile) is aimed to simplify Makefiles, in a new language!

As simple as the language might be, it is also very simple to setup!

_Quick Note_: <sub><sup>You have to be root to do this</sup></sub>

Step one:

To setup the 'run' file, simply type the following:
```sh
bash setup.sh
```

setup.sh does the following:
1. It gather your current directory
2. It then copies the run file _from_ your current directory _to_ **/usr/local/bin**

Step two: </br>
Type 'run'!
